👋 Hi everyone! I'm Camilla, a data analyst/engineer
My background in Archaeological Science gives me a unique lens on the world of data. In my previous career as a STEM and archaeology researcher, Excel was my bread and butter—data wrangling, cleaning, and analysis were part of my everyday workflow.
But over time, I started to feel like I was hitting a ceiling. I wanted to go deeper, to really understand and shape the data I was working with.
That curiosity led me to experiment with R and ggplot2 to create visualisations for my research—and suddenly, a whole new world opened up.
Fast forward to today: I’ve just completed an intensive 13-week Data Engineering bootcamp with Northcoders, and I’m excited to break into tech as a data analyst (which, in many ways, I was already doing!) and as a data engineer.
I love solving problems, finding patterns, and telling stories with data—and I’m always up for learning something new.
