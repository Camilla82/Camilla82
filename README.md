# 👋 Hi everyone! I'm Camilla  

My background in **Archaeological Science** gives me a unique lens on the world of data. In my previous career as a STEM researcher, I worked daily with **large, messy datasets** — wrangling, cleaning, and analysing them to uncover hidden patterns in historical materials.  

Over time, curiosity pushed me to go deeper: I started experimenting with **R and ggplot2**, then moved into **Python** to expand my data analysis and visualisation. That spark eventually led me to the **Northcoders Data Engineering bootcamp**, where I trained intensively in **Python, SQL, AWS, CI/CD, and infrastructure-as-code**.  

Now, I’m building on that foundation by moving into **AI and machine learning**. My current focus is experimenting with **predictive modelling** and **large language models (LLMs)** — testing workflows on **AWS Bedrock, Hugging Face, and Ollama**, and exploring **prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and cloud deployment**.  

I love solving problems, finding patterns, and telling stories with data — whether through a well-structured pipeline, a statistical model, or an AI-driven insight.
